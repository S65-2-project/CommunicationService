# communication-service
This is the communication service of the Lisk delegate market project. It was made as a groupproject for Fontys. 

It was made with .NET Core 3.1 in combination with [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/signalr) for the Lisk Delegate Market.

The other services can be found [here](https://github.com/S65-2-project). If you want to see the live product it can be found [here](https://delegate-market.nl).

Via this service the user can live chat with another user to negotiate deals in the application.

## External sources
To run this project you will need to run the following services:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/re)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io)

## Configuration
This is an example for the appsettings.json file that is needed to configure the application. 

```json
{
    "JwtSettings": {
    "SecretJWT": ""
  },
  "ChatDatabaseSettings": {
    "ChatCollectionName":"",
    "ConnectionString": "",
    "DatabaseName": ""
  },
  "Sentry": {
    "Dsn": "",
    "IncludeRequestPayload" : true,
    "SendDefaultPii" : true,
    "MinimumBreadcrumbLevel": "",
    "MinimumEventLevel": "",
    "AttachStackTrace": true,
    "Debug": true,
    "DiagnosticsLevel": ""
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "",
      "Microsoft": "",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": ""
    }
  },
  "HubSettings": {
    "Url": ""
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

## Github Actions
The project runs on GitHub Actions with 3 different configuration.

1. All feature/* branches will be tested and build.
2. In addition to the steps of step 1 develop branch pushes will also be deliver to dockerhub and deploy to our develop environment.
3. All pushes on a tag will be deliverd and deployed to our kubernetes environment.   

To reproduce the Pipeline the following secrets are needed:
- DOCKER_ACCESS_TOKEN : The access token or password of the docker registry
- DOCKER_USER : The username of the docker registry
- GPG_PASSPHRASE : The secret passphrase that is used to encrypt and decrypt the GPG files
- KUBE_CONFIG : The kubeconfig file to access the kubernetes cluster
- SONARCLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN : The access token for sonarcloud

## Delivery
All the images are stored on DockerHub. These are also on a public repo and can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/s652/communication-service).
All images with a SHA tag are development builds and versions with a version tag are production builds. 

## Deployment
The project is deployed to a kubernetes cluster. in de ./kube_develop folder are all the different kubernetes configuration files for the development builds.  In the ./kube folder are the configuration files for the production builds. 

To make a deployment on a kubernets cluster it needs to have an running [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/). Once it is installed the deployment will  automatically also create a cluster issuer for it. 

- autoscaler.yaml -> this is the autoscaler for the deployment
- cluster-issuer.yaml-> to ensure there is a cluster issuer for the TLS certificates
- deployment.yaml -> the deployment of the service itself
- ingress.yaml -> the ingress that is used to access the deployment from outside, it is enabled with a TLS certificate
- service.yaml -> the service that exposes the deployment for other services and resources within the cluster
